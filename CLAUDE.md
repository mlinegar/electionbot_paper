- Maintain the original V1.0 functionality and codebase
- Use a consistent Python environment throughout
- Ensure all setup instructions are documented in README

## Technical Requirements
- Python environment: [TO BE SPECIFIED]
- Original webpage implementation
- Original chatbot logic and analysis code
- Nginx configuration for deployment
- Legacy data files required for V1.0 operation

## Important Notes
