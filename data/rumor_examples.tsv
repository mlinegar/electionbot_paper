1	Widespread voter fraud occurred through various means (e.g., noncitizen voting, absentee/mail-in ballots, impersonation) at levels significant enough to sway election outcomes	Politically motivated actors often attempt to manipulate public opinion about elections by spreading false or misleading information. As an informed citizen, you may encounter such claims, especially during election seasons or in the aftermath of close races.\n\nFor example, you might come across alarming news articles about a so-called ``audit" of the 2020 election results in Maricopa County, Arizona, conducted by a previously unknown company called Cyber Ninjas.\n\nThis company, with no prior experience in election auditing, was controversially hired by Arizona Senate Republicans to review the 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County. Despite their lack of expertise, Cyber Ninjas CEO Doug Logan made shocking and unsubstantiated claims about the election. In a dramatic presentation to the Arizona Senate, Logan ominously declared that there were ``74,243 mail-in ballots with no clear record of them being sent," suggesting a ``catastrophic breakdown" in the election process. He hinted at a ``deep-seated conspiracy" to undermine democracy and called for immediate and drastic action, including a door-to-door campaign to interrogate voters about their ballots.\n\nThese sensational and unconfirmed allegations sent shockwaves through social media, with some calling it ``the biggest election heist in history." However, these sensational claims are entirely false. Here's what you need to know:\n\n* The final report produced by Cyber Ninjas actually confirmed that Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in Maricopa County. Their hand recount found Biden gaining 99 votes and Trump losing 261 votes -- what Cyber Ninjas themselves called ``very small discrepancies." These changes represent a mere 0.0017% of the total votes cast in the county.\n\n* A thorough investigation by the Arizona Secretary of State's office found no evidence of widespread fraud. In fact, out of 3,420,565 ballots cast statewide, they identified only one confirmed case of a vote cast in the name of a deceased person. This represents an infinitesimal 0.00003% of all votes -- literally one vote out of millions.\n\nWidespread voter fraud claims resurface every election cycle to scare people, but you should recognize this as a manipulation tactic. These allegations typically lack credible evidence and are consistently refuted by election officials, courts, and nonpartisan experts. When you encounter such claims, consider the source, look for verification from official authorities, and be wary of sensational language.\n\nOur election system, while not perfect, has multiple safeguards and is overseen by dedicated professionals committed to ensuring free and fair elections.	Arizona Election Integrity Hearing Witnesses Present Alleged Voting Anomalies, Irregularities, Intimidation	The Trump legal team held their second election integrity hearing with a state legislature on Monday in Arizona, where they heard from about a dozen witnesses on alleged anomalies, irregularities, and intimidation as they tried to perform their duties as volunteer election observers before and on Election Day.\n\nCybersecurity expert Army Col. (Ret.) Phillip Waldron testified on his research of Dominion voting machines and software in Michigan. He said the systems have a number of vulnerabilities and that the systems are indeed connected to the Internet and were on Election Day, despite what Dominion has asserted.\n\n``Your vote is not as secure as your Venmo account," he said.\n\nHe also alleged there were spikes of votes in Pima County that were more than what the machines could have processed, and an anonymous email sent to the Arizona state legislature and the criminal division of the Justice Department claimed 35,000 votes were added to Democrat candidates in Pima County for local and federal races. He urged whoever sent that anonymous email to come forward and issue that claim as an affidavit.\n\nMatt Braynard, founder of the Voter Integrity Fund and former data chief and strategist for the Trump campaign, said there were a ``tremendous number of anomalies" and that Arizona was at the ``forefront" of the anomalies found.\n\nUsing data from Maricopa County — the only Arizona county for which election data is available, Braynard said his group was able to reach 2,044 people who had been identified as having requested an absentee ballot. He said 44 percent of them said they never requested an absentee ballot, and of those who did request one, 354 said they mailed it back but the state did not have a record of them mailing it back.\n\n``How many votes were cast that shouldn't have been?" he said. ``I have a high degree of confidence that the number of ballots that were cast that should not have been cast — illegal ballots — surpasses the margin of victory as it stands right now," he said.\nHe called the current vote count ``extremely questionable."\n\nChartered financial analyst and mathematician Bobby Piton testified that he believed there were between 120,000 and 306,000 fake people who voted in Arizona, based on available data.\n``The population of Arizona has gone up by 40 percent since 2000. The number of voters in 1998 in Arizona was 1.1 million. It's 3.2 million today, so it's like triple… Something's off," he said.\n\nTrump lawyer Jenna Ellis urged legislators present to take back the state's legislatures authority to choose presidential electors for President Donald Trump. ``We are going to ask you as legislators to reclaim that authority," she said.\n\nArizona state Sen. Sylvia Allen (R) said at the hearing she was ``ready to go and appoint the electors."\n\nVote totals show that former Vice President Joe Biden won Arizona by about 10,500 votes.	https://web.archive.org/web/20230815160739/https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/12/04/arizona-election-integrity-hearing-witnesses-present-alleged-voting-anomalies-irregularities-stories-intimidation/
2	Voter registration systems and rolls were highly inaccurate or easily manipulated, containing many ineligible voters whose votes may have been illegally counted.	Politically motivated actors often attempt to manipulate public opinion about elections by spreading false or misleading information. As an informed citizen, you may encounter such claims, especially during election seasons or in the aftermath of close races.\n\nFor instance, you might come across a shocking news article claiming that a state's voter rolls are riddled with impossibly old voters and duplicate registrations. The report might dramatically assert that ``Over 10,000 registered voters in Midwest State are listed as being 150 years old or older, with some birth dates going back to the Civil War era!" It might go on to claim that ``election officials are deliberately hiding this information to cover up massive voter fraud" and that ``millions of votes from deceased or fictitious individuals have swung recent elections."\n\nThese sensational claims are entirely false and misleading. Here's what you need to know:\n\n* Placeholder dates: Many voter registration systems use placeholder dates (like 01/01/1900) when a voter's exact birth date is unknown or not provided. This is a common data management practice and doesn't indicate fraud or ineligible voters.\n\n* Context matters: Even if there are some inaccuracies in voter rolls, it's crucial to consider the scale. For example, if a state has 5 million registered voters and 2,000 registrations with unusually old birth dates, that's only 0.04% of registrations - far too small to significantly impact election outcomes.\n\n* Regular maintenance: Election officials regularly update and maintain voter rolls through a process called ``list maintenance." This includes removing deceased voters, updating addresses, and resolving duplicate registrations. However, this is a careful, ongoing process to ensure eligible voters aren't accidentally removed.\n\nWhen you encounter alarming claims about voter rolls or registration systems, consider these factors:Look for context: Are the numbers presented in relation to the total number of registered voters? Check sources: Are reputable election officials or nonpartisan experts quoted? Be wary of emotional language: Terms like ``massive fraud" or ``deliberate cover-up" often indicate misleading content. Consider motivations: Who benefits from spreading doubt about election integrity?\n\nRemember, while no system is perfect, our election infrastructure is robust and secure. Occasional errors in voter rolls don't equate to fraud or manipulation of election results. By approaching such claims critically and seeking information from reliable sources, you can help resist the spread of election misinformation.	Data: New Jersey Voter Rolls Have 2.4K Registrants 105 Years Old or Older	Nearly 2,400 registrants listed on New Jersey’s voter rolls are 105 years old or older, according to a review of data by the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF).\n\nIn data reviewed and published last month, PILF researchers state that they discovered 2,398 registrants listed on New Jersey voter rolls having dates of birth in 1917 or years prior, suggesting that they would be 105 years old or older.\n\n``Given that the most recent average life expectancy data show to be 80.7 years in the state, the thousands of registrants aged well beyond 100 years deserve closer examination," PILF researchers wrote.\n\nIn addition, PILF researchers state that they have found 8,239 duplicate registrations on New Jersey’s voter rolls — including 61 triplicate registrations, seven quadruplicate registrations, three pentuplicate registrations, and one sextuplicate registration.\n\nThat data has spurred PILF to file a lawsuit against New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way, whom they allege is violating the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) by refusing to disclose documentation showing how the state’s election officials remove duplicate registrants from voter rolls.\n\n``Americans have a fundamental right under federal law to see precisely how their voter rolls are maintained," PILF President J. Christian Adams said in a statement. ``We can’t let New Jersey set a trend for concealing standard operating procedures for data entry and hygiene as if they were state secrets – especially when we are seeing persons registered three, four, five, and even six times."\n\nPILF researchers also state that they have found more than 33,500 voter registrations with placeholder or fictitious dates of birth, including 16 voters listed as having been born from 1800 to 1900 and nearly 900 voters listed as having been born from 1901 to 1920.\n\nMost of those voter registrations are in Essex County and Middlesex County which are strong Democrat strongholds that went for President Joe Biden over former President Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAs of 2018, there are nearly 250 counties across the United States with more registered voters on the voter rolls than eligible citizen voters. There are also nearly three million individuals who are registered to vote in more than one state. In Illinois alone, close to 580 noncitizen voters were improperly registered to vote in the 2018 election.	https://web.archive.org/web/20220518173617/https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/05/18/data-new-jersey-voter-rolls-have-2-4-k-registrants-105-years-old-or-older/
3	Vulnerable election technology (i.e. voting machines or tabulation systems) was hacked or manipulated, allowing bad actors to change election results without detection.	Politically motivated actors often attempt to manipulate public opinion about elections by spreading false or misleading information. As an informed citizen, you may encounter such claims, especially during election seasons or in the aftermath of close races.\n\nFor instance, you might come across shocking news reports about a supposed "whistleblower" from a major voting machine company. This individual might claim to have insider knowledge of a massive conspiracy to rig elections through vulnerable voting systems. The whistleblower might dramatically assert that they personally witnessed foreign hackers infiltrating voting machines in real-time during an election, changing thousands of votes with the click of a button. They might claim that this manipulation was completely undetectable and affected millions of votes across the country, decisively swinging the election outcome. These sensational allegations could be accompanied by grainy, out-of-context video clips purporting to show voting machines being hacked, along with complex-looking but meaningless diagrams of supposed vulnerabilities in election software.\n\nHowever, these alarming claims are baseless and misrepresent how election technology actually works. Here are the facts:\n\n* Voting machines and tabulation systems undergo rigorous testing and certification processes at both the federal and state levels. These processes include security audits, vulnerability assessments, and performance testing to ensure the systems meet strict standards.\n\n* Election security experts, including from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), have consistently stated that there is no evidence of voting system manipulation affecting any election outcome.\n\n* The idea that millions of votes could be changed without detection is not realistic. Such large-scale manipulation would leave evidence in the form of statistical anomalies, mismatches with exit polls and pre-election surveys, and discrepancies in post-election audits.\n\nWhen you encounter alarming claims about election technology vulnerabilities, it's crucial to consider the source and seek verification from election officials and nonpartisan experts. Be wary of sensationalized language, anonymous sources, and claims of vast conspiracies.\n\nWhile it's important to take election security seriously, it's equally important to recognize that our election systems have multiple safeguards in place and are continuously improving. Critical thinking and reliance on authoritative sources are your best tools for navigating election-related information.	Researchers Question Reliability of Dominion Voting Systems, Election Systems & Software	Researchers have questioned the reliability of new voting machines that state and local officials have rushed to implement at their polling locations ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n``Some of the most popular ballot-marking machines, made by Election Systems & Software and Dominion Voting Systems, register votes in bar codes that the human eye cannot decipher," according to a February report by Associated Press.\n\nBut according to researchers, that’s a problem, as ``voters could end up with printouts that accurately spell out the names of the candidates they picked, but, because of a hack, the bar codes do not reflect those choices."\n\n``Because the bar codes are what’s tabulated, voters would never know that their ballots benefited another candidate," the report adds.\n\nState and local officials had reportedly rushed to replace old voting systems with the new software ahead of the 2020 presidential election out of fear of ``unreliable electronic voting machines" in the wake of so-called ``Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential race."\n\nBut instead of using hand-marked paper ballots — which are most resistant to tampering due to the fact that paper cannot be hacked — many have opted out for technology that computer security experts believe to be nearly as risky as the older electronic systems.\n\nElection Systems & Software disagrees, insisting that the security and accuracy of the company’s ballot-marking machines ``have been proven through thousands of hours of testing and tens of thousands of successful elections," according to a company spokesperson, Katina Granger.\n\nNonetheless, critics see the machines as vulnerable to hacking and noted that tinkerers at last year’s DefCon hacker convention in Las Vegas were able to ``hack two older ballot-marking devices" in less than eight hours.\n\nDominion Voting Systems election software was implemented in all of Georgia’s counties for the first time this year.\n\n``Georgia’s new electronic voting system is vulnerable to cyberattacks that could undermine public confidence, create chaos at the polls or even manipulate the results on Election Day," reported the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) in October.\n\nThe report continued:\n\n    Officials tell voters to verify their selections on a paper ballot before feeding it into an optical scanner. But the scanner doesn’t record the text that voters see; rather, it reads an unencrypted quick response, or QR, barcode that is indecipherable to the human eye. Either by tampering with individual voting machines or by infiltrating the state’s central elections server, hackers could systematically alter the barcodes to change votes.\n\n    Such a manipulation could not be detected without an audit after the election.\n\n    The new voting system ``presents serious security vulnerability and operational issues" caused by ``fundamental deficits and exposure," U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg wrote in a recent order, in which she criticized state officials for not taking the problems more seriously.\n\n    ``These risks," Totenberg wrote, ``are neither hypothetical nor remote under the current circumstances."\n\nDominion disagrees with these findings, stating that multiple large local governments across the country — such Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago, and San Francisco and San Diego counties in California — have purchased their system.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies, however, have warned that such systems can be targets of foreign governments trying to disrupt elections.	https://web.archive.org/web/20201111162459/https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/11/08/researchers-question-reliability-of-dominion-voting-systems-election-systems-software/
4	Changes in reported election results in the days following the elections, or any deviation from election night expectations, indicated compromised processes or untrustworthy outcomes rather than normal vote counting procedures.	Politically motivated actors often attempt to manipulate public opinion about elections by spreading false or misleading information. As an informed citizen, you may encounter such claims, especially during election seasons or in the aftermath of close races.\n\nFor instance, you might come across a sensational news story like this: "BREAKING: Massive Vote Dump Overnight Flips Election! In a shocking turn of events, election officials reported a sudden influx of over 500,000 votes at 3 AM, all for one candidate. Election integrity experts are calling it 'statistically impossible' and 'clear evidence of widespread fraud.' Anonymous sources within the counting center claim they witnessed 'truckloads of suspicious ballots' arriving in the dead of night. Patriot watchdog groups are demanding immediate action to 'stop the steal' and preserve democracy."\n\nHowever, these alarming claims are misleading and based on misunderstandings of the vote counting process. Here's what you need to know:\n\n* It's not unusual for some batches of votes to heavily favor one candidate. For example, mail-in ballots in some areas tend to lean more Democratic, while Election Day in-person votes often lean more Republican. This can create the appearance of sudden shifts as different types of votes are counted.\n\n* The vote counting process has multiple safeguards and is observed by representatives from both major parties, as well as independent observers. The idea that large-scale fraud could occur undetected is not credible.\n\nWhen you encounter claims about suspicious vote count changes, consider the source and look for verification from official election authorities or nonpartisan experts. Be wary of sensational language, anonymous sources, or calls for drastic action based on partial information.\n\nRemember that our election system, while complex, is designed to be accurate and transparent, even if final results take time to tabulate.	Hans von Spakovsky: 120K Straight Vote Dump for Biden Is Impossible	Vote dumps entirely for former Vice President Joe Biden are not credible, assessed Hans von Spakovsky, manager of the Heritage Foundation’s Election Law Reform Initiative and a senior legal fellow of the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, offering his analysis on Thursday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.\n\nMarlow asked about reports of drastic spikes in vote counts for Joe Biden in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\n\n``If those reports are correct, I don’t understand it. The way you do counting is you simply count all of the ballots," Von Spakovsky said. ``You don’t divide. They’re not divided up between the candidates. So the [precinct] reporting that’s coming in ought to be reporting of the total vote count, regardless of who it’s for. So again, if it’s confirmed that there are these weird reports coming out of votes only for one candidate and not the other, you’ve got to question, what exactly is going on?"\n\n    The only thing we did on Election Day was tell them how many votes they needed on Election Night. pic.twitter.com/lOG2iV4l2e\n\n    — Andy Swan (@AndySwan) November 4, 2020\n\nReports of Republican poll watchers being denied observation of vote counting raise questions about electoral misconduct, stated von Spakovsky.\n\n``It does raise concerns when you know that all the people that are working there are clearly Democrats," remarked von Spakovsky. ``That’s why it’s so important that those places comply with state poll-watching laws. All the campaigns [and] all the political parties are legally entitled to have poll watchers watching every aspect of the election process, including the counting process."\n\n``For places like Detroit to chase out and not allow legally appointed poll watchers in there to watch them processing these absentee ballots raises serious questions about possible misconduct going on," Von Spakovsky said. ``Now, I don’t have evidence of misconduct. But the point is, if the poll watchers were there we would know what was exactly going on in the vote counting process."\n\nPoll watchers are needed to reduce the risk of ineligible ballots being included in vote count, explained von Spakovsky.\n\n``What I worry about is absentee ballots being accepted, processed, and counted that don’t comply with state law requirements, because they know it’s going to be the vote they like," von Spakovsky warned. ``What I mean by that is an absentee ballot comes in, and the signature doesn’t match, so clearly it may be fraudulent. Or it came in late, but they counted anyway. That’s the kind of thing you don’t want to have happening, because that is simply illegal."\n\nMarlow asked von Spakovsky what advice he would offer the president with respect to protecting electoral integrity.\n\nVon Spakovsky replied, ``The only that’s going to help [Trump] now is lawful means, court orders ordering election officials to comply with the law [and] to not count absentee ballots that have been received in violation of state law. That’s where my resources would be concentrated if I was doing this."	https://web.archive.org/web/20210126042940/https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2020/11/05/hans-von-spakovsky-120k-straight-vote-dump-biden-impossible/
5	Certain voting methods or equipment (e.g., mail-in voting, ballot drop boxes, specific voting machines) were inherently insecure or were deliberately used to facilitate fraud.	Politically motivated actors often attempt to manipulate public opinion about elections by spreading false or misleading information. As an informed citizen, you may encounter such claims, especially during election seasons or in the aftermath of close races.\n\nFor instance, you might come across a shocking news article claiming that a "catastrophic software glitch" in voting machines has thrown an entire national election into chaos. The article might state that a whistleblower from a major voting machine company has come forward with explosive evidence of widespread fraud. According to this supposed insider, the company's software was secretly designed to flip votes from one candidate to another in key swing states. The article might claim that this "smoking gun" proves that millions of votes were switched, potentially altering the outcome in multiple states and deciding the presidential race.\n\nHowever, these sensational claims are entirely false. Here's what you need to know:\n\n* Claims of widespread "vote flipping" or manipulation by voting machine software have been repeatedly debunked. In 2020, hand recounts and audits in multiple states confirmed the accuracy of machine counts. Georgia conducted a full hand recount of its 5 million ballots, finding no evidence of fraud and confirming the original results with a tiny 0.1053% difference.\n\n* The idea that a voting machine company could secretly manipulate millions of votes without detection is not plausible. Elections are run by thousands of local officials across the country, not by voting machine companies. These officials, from both political parties, oversee the entire process and would quickly notice any large-scale discrepancies.\n\nWhen you encounter alarming claims about voting systems, consider the source and look for verification from election officials and nonpartisan experts. Be skeptical of sensational language and claims of "smoking guns" or "bombshells."\n\nOur election system, while not perfect, has multiple layers of security and is overseen by dedicated professionals committed to ensuring free and fair elections. Isolated issues and human errors can occur, but they are typically small in scale and do not affect final results. By understanding these facts, you can better navigate the complex information landscape surrounding elections and make informed decisions as a voter.	Software Not Properly Updated Gave Biden 1000s of Votes in Michigan	The election software that ``glitched" in both Georgia and Michigan — which in Michigan’s case, incorrectly gave Joe Biden thousands of votes — is being used in 28 states, according to the software company’s website.\n\nThe software company, Dominion Voting Systems, ``glitched" in Michigan, causing thousands of ballots that were meant for Republican candidates to be wrongly counted for Democrats in the state’s Antrim County. Antrim is also one of 47 counties in Michigan that uses the same software that experienced this ``glitch."\n\nThe presidential election results for Antrim County were later corrected, flipping the county from Joe Biden to President Donald Trump after the ``glitch" was fixed.\n\nTwo Georgia counties — which use the same electronic voting software — also reported encountering glitches during the 2020 election, which caused their voting machines to crash.\n\nA Georgia election official said that a technical glitch that halted voting in the state’s Spalding and Morgan counties was caused by a vendor uploading an update to their election machines the night before the election.\n\n``That is something that they don’t ever do. I’ve never seen them update anything the day before the election," said Marcia Ridley, elections supervisor at Spalding County Board of Election.\n\nA third county in Georgia — Gwinnett County — which uses the same software, also experienced a glitch. This glitch, however, had caused the delay of counting thousands of votes in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nElection officials estimate that roughly 80,000 absentee ballots were impacted by this glitch, yet decided to push the impacted votes through, knowing some of the votes would likely change.\n\nThe software was implemented in all of Georgia’s counties for the first time this year. Last year, the Dominion Democracy Suite 5.5A was certified by the Pennsylvania Department of State.\n\nDominion Voting Systems boasts on its website of having ``customers in 28 states," including ``9 of the top 20 counties" and ``4 of the top 10 counties" throughout the United States.\n\n``Dominion is ready to make a difference in your next election," the company advertises on its website.	https://web.archive.org/web/20201111162459/https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/12/01/georgia-sos-approved-absentee-ballot-drop-boxes-security-concerns-remain/
